# Machine Learning Exploration with Titanic Dataset

A project for exploring machine learning with Titanic Survived Passangers Dataset as the case of study. The dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). There are several topics discussed in this project, which are:
- Exploration Data Analysis (EDA)
- Models Comparation
- ML for Lazy Person Like Me
- More in the future 

**disclaimer**: This project is coming from my perspective. So, let's discuss!
