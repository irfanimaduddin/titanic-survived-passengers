# Machine Learning Exploration with Titanic Dataset

A project for exploring machine learning with Titanic Survived Passangers Dataset as the case of study. The dataset is from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic). There are several topics discussed in this project, which are:
- [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/irfanimaduddin/titanic-survived-passengers/blob/master/01%20-%20titanic-survived-passenger%20(EDA).ipynb)
- [Models Comparation](https://github.com/irfanimaduddin/titanic-survived-passengers/blob/master/02%20-%20titanic-survived-passenger%20(models).ipynb)
- [ML for Lazy Person Like Me](https://github.com/irfanimaduddin/titanic-survived-passengers/blob/master/03%20-%20titanic-survived-passenger%20(lazy).ipynb)
- More in the future 

**disclaimer**: This project is coming from my perspective. So, let's discuss!
